I recently became interested in Slow Scan TV so this is just an experiment to see how hard it is to get something working.

The WAVE file reader can't do PCM.
It seems to work ok on Martin M1/M2 and Scottie S1 Files.
I'm working on PD180 support, but I don't have the color decoding working correctly yet.
